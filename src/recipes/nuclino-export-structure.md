# Exported Structure

- TOC of categories in: index.md
    - list of links build references to categories
- Category TOC list of links again to concrete recipes

# New Structure Idea

- (Sub)-Categories in folders with index files with links to "items"
- index.md can referre relative to different items/categories
  - should be possible from everywhere
